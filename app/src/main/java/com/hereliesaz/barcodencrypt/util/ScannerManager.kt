 * The Central Nerve Ganglion.

 * that must perform it. This is crucial for components that run outside of an Activity context
 * (like a [android.app.Service]) but need to launch a UI-based scanner.
 *
 * It works using a combination of a [MutableSharedFlow] to broadcast the request and a simple
 * callback to return the result.
 *
 * This architecture prevents the spontaneous growth of parasitic structures like the `ScannerTrampolineActivity`.
